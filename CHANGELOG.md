# Changelog

## v0.1.0-alpha

Developer preview for a local-first skill router and context reducer.

### Added

- Local recursive `SKILL.md` discovery, lexical index, Chroma vector index, hybrid search, `view`, `where`, `list`, and `use`.
- Codex router skill and installer with managed `AGENTS.md` patch.
- OpenClaw installer for workspace, plugin, and built-in skill roots.
- Hermes installer with native skill mirroring, context-reduction mode, and rollback manifest.
- Migration scripts for Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, and Vellum AI.
- Native skill sync for Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, and OpenClaw roots before common retrieval commands.
- Registered hosted update client with SHA256 archive verification and safe zip extraction.
- Registered local enhancement-script download with checksum verification.
- Team sync MVP: create, join request, pending list, master approval, temporary auto-approval, and sync.
- Public repo self-update from GitHub releases or tags.

### Known Limitations

- Hosted registry access is early-access and requires registration.
- Enterprise Skill Lock is planned, not implemented in v0.1.0-alpha.
- Hosted archive signature metadata exists, but the current client enforces SHA256 verification only. Cryptographic signature verification is planned.
- Install from a GitHub clone for now. PyPI packaging should wait until repo assets such as scripts, router skills, docs, and packs are included and tested in wheels.
- OpenClaw installer modifies the selected workspace and patches `AGENTS.md` unless `--no-agents-patch` is passed.
- Warm daemon mode is experimental and not yet the default retrieval path.

### Suggested Smoke Tests

- Windows PowerShell: `install-codex.ps1`, `install-hermes.ps1 -Mode evacuate-visible-skills` dry-run.
- Linux/macOS: `pip install -e ".[all]"`, `reindex`, `search`, `view`, `serve`.
- Hermes sandbox: fake `.hermes/skills`, apply context reduction, verify only router remains visible, then rollback.
- OpenClaw sandbox: fake workspace, run installer, verify `AGENTS.md` patch and search.
- Unregistered instance: verify local `search` works and hosted `updates check` fails with registration-required wording.
